# UnitOfWork.BookStore
Example of implementation of the Unit of Work Pattern

* This project has examples using **Entity Framework Core** and **Dapper** working separately, integrating the use of the Repository Pattern + Unit of Work Pattern.

* The use of dependency injection was prioritized in the relationship between the repositories and unit of work.

## Patterns/Technologies:
* ASP.NET Core 3.1
* Repository Pattern
* Unit of Work
* Entity Framework Core 3.1
* Dapper (used through the [RepositoryHelpers](https://github.com/TBertuzzi/RepositoryHelpers) package)
* [DotNet.DynamicInjector](https://github.com/TBertuzzi/DotNetDynamicInjector)
